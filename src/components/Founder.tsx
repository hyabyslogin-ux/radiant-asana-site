                  Everything you experience at Bali Yoga School community has come from our great leader, 
                  Yogi Himanshu Joshi. He is the most honest, hard-working, authentic person we can ever meet. 
                  His yoga journey started from a severe injury after playing sports for a long time at the 
                  state / national level. Yoga brought him up into the light from the darkness.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  He contributed to the success of other yoga schools in Rishikesh, and then built his own â€” 
                  Himalayan Yoga Association and Bali Yoga School. He continues to expand the community, 
                  uplifting lives for the better. Feel his essence in every detail of the school and learning.
